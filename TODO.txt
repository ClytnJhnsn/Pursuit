TODO:
    - implement the rest of the movement strategies
    - create a better system for interfacing with a simulation
    - figure out how to handle the data
    - implement decision proccess

MOVEMENT STRATEGIES:
    Look at the write-up, implement mentioned pursuit strategies.
    Implement some simple evasion strategies. Maybe evasion starts 
    only when predator gets within a certain range. Also, we can 
    simulate evasiveness by making prey change direction quickly
    when predator gets close (for this to be useful, tho, we might
    have to try to simulate agility, meaning making changing 
    direction costly).

SIMULATION INTERFACE:
    Could make a class for this, could also be done in main.cc.
    What we need is a way to change the certain things about each
    instance of a simulation. Sim class probably needs to have an 
    overloaded constructor with input parameters to specify things 
    like initial entity positions.

HANDLING DATA:
    Doesn't necessarily need to be too complicated. Could maybe 
    even be done by printing to the command line so that we can 
    copy that data and paste elsewhere (like excel). 

DECISION PROCESS:
    Not yet sure what we're gonna do here.
